# Graphical User Interface for Linux server on Google Cloud Platform

This bash script installs automatically a graphical user interface on your Linux server on Google Cloud Platform. This Notebook is based on the article posted on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-set-up-linux-desktop-google-cloud-platform-tuomas-eerola/ 

## Getting Started

You can run this script

1. As a Startup Script in Google Compute Engine when launching a new Linux VM; or
2. In the SSH console window in Google Compute Engine. 

Note: Your new user will be automatically added to the Group "sudoers". If you don't want to allow the user to run programs with security privileges, please comment out the line in the script.

## Option 1 - Run as a Startup Script

*Go to your Google Cloud Console. https://console.cloud.google.com

*Go to Compute Engine > VM Instances.

*Select "Create Instance".

*Select a boot disk (this script supports Debian or Linux).

*Expand "Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy"

*On "Startup script" field, type (replace "myusername" and "mypassword" with your preferred user credentials)

i. For Debian
```
   wget https://github.com/eerolat/setup-google-linux/raw/master/install.sh
   sh install.sh -d myusername mypassword
```
ii. For Ubuntu
```
   wget https://github.com/eerolat/setup-google-linux/raw/master/install.sh
   sh install.sh -u myusername mypassword
```
*Click "Create" button.

*Wait for your Linux VM to start.

*Open a Remote Desktop Connection to your new Linux VM. The IP address of your VM instance is shown in the "VM Instances" view. Log in using your GUI username and password.

## Option 2 - Run in the SSH Console Window

*We assume that you have created an instance using a Linux boot disk (this script supports Debian or Linux).

*Go to your Google Cloud Console. https://console.cloud.google.com

*Go to Compute Engine > VM Instances.

*Click the "SSH" button next to your VM instance to open a SSH Console Window. 

*In the console window, type (replace "myusername" and "mypassword" with your preferred user credentials)

i. On Debian
```
   wget https://github.com/eerolat/setup-google-linux/raw/master/install.sh
   sh install.sh -d myusername mypassword
```
ii. On Ubuntu
```
   wget https://github.com/eerolat/setup-google-linux/raw/master/install.sh
   sh install.sh -u myusername mypassword
```
*Wait for the script to finish.

*Open a Remote Desktop Connection to your new Linux VM. The IP address of your VM instance is shown in the "VM Instances" view. Log in using your GUI username and password.
